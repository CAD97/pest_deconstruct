# pest-deconstruct

(Working title, also considered: `pest-ast`, `from-pest`, just making this part of `pest`)

Pest-deconstruct provides a structured manner to go from the "dynamically typed" Pest Parse Tree
to a strongly typed (Abstract) Syntax Tree, as well as a derive to do so automatically.
In the future, it's planned to optionally additionally check the source grammar to statically
prevent issues that are currently detected at runtime.

In the _future_ ðŸ¦„, pest-ast may provide a way of defining grammar directly on the AST nodes.

This library is now dogfooded for the [nafi](https://github.com/nafi-lang/rust-nafi) programming language.
